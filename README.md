<h1 align="center">Atoti Spring Boot Template</h1>
<p align="center">A minimalist Atoti project built with Spring Boot for you to edit, customize and use as a base for your Atoti Java projects.</p>

---

## üìã Details

This project aims to be an example of how to run Atoti as a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot)
application. Atoti was already a *Spring* application, but with the power of *Spring Boot* we can simplify our
dependency management, deployment model, and many other goodies that come with Spring Boot.

This project is a starting point for your own projects and implementations. You should be able to take this, customize
it and get a cube up and running in a few minutes.

## üì¶ Installation

#### Requirements

- Java 21
- Maven 3
- Atoti jar files (commercial software)
- Running the application requires a license for the Atoti software.

Clone or download this repository and run `mvn clean install`. This will generate a jar file, which can be run using
standard java commands.

**Note:** If your build is unsuccessful, try skipping tests: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

## üíª Usage

#### Running the fat jar

The project contains, out of the box, an extremely simple datastore schema and small `trades.csv` file. You can find
this file in `src/main/resources/data`.<br>

```bash
java -jar ./target/atoti-spring-boot-template.jar
```

###### Running on macOS

Add the following argument `-Dactiveviam.chunkAllocatorKey=mmap` to your JVM, so it then becomes:

```bash
java -Dactiveviam.chunkAllocatorKey=mmap -jar ./target/atoti-spring-boot-template.jar
```

**Note:** If unable to start the Atoti Spring Boot application, [you may need to add some additional arguments as
well](https://docs.activeviam.com/products/atoti/server/latest/docs/configuration/java_version/#jvm-options), try the following:

```bash
java --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED -Dactiveviam.chunkAllocatorKey=mmap -jar ./target/atoti-spring-boot-template.jar
```

#### Running from the IDE

We provide 3 run configurations for IntelliJ:
- `AtotiSpringBootApplication (no OTEL)`: does not use the OpenTelemetry config, uses the `application-local.yml`.
- `AtotiSpringBootApplication OTEL`: uses the OpenTelemetry config, uses the `application.yml`, start the OTEL stack else you will see some exceptions.
- `AtotiSpringBootApplication OTEL w/agent`: uses the OpenTelemetry agent, this run config has `-Dotel.javaagent.enabled=true` which is part of this project.<br>
it sets a special bean `openTelemetry` defined in `AtotiSpringBootApplication`, in order to avoid a mismatch in the OpenTelemetry SDK configuration.<br>
Note that Atoti does already OpenTelemetry manual instrumentation, [we are not supposed to start the OpenTelemetry Java agent which does the out-of-the-box instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/spring-boot-starter/) since Atoti does it already.<br>
We do this just in case you find yourself in this context.

#### Connecting to the Atoti Server

- Excel: you can connect to the cube from Excel, by connecting to an 'Analysis Services' source. 
The default URL to use when running locally is [http://localhost:9090/xmla](http://localhost:9090/xmla).

- AtotiUI, ActiveViam's user interface for exploring the cube, will be available from [http://localhost:9090/ui](http://localhost:9090/ui).

- AdminUI console: [http://localhost:9090/admin/ui](http://localhost:9090/admin/ui).
- List of REST endpoints provided can be found at [http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/index.html).

The default security credentials are `admin:admin`, but can be modified in the `application.yml` file.<br>
For a real production deployment you should probably use LDAP instead of hardcoding the users in the `application.yml` file.<br>
It is also recommended that you change the JWT key pair in `application.yml` by running the class `JwtUtil` and
generating a new key pair.
